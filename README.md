## Steps We Have Performed

### Step 1: Lipophilicity Prediction

- **Objective**: Assess the lipophilicity (hydrophobic or hydrophilic characteristics) of drug-like molecules, as it affects pharmacokinetics, including absorption, distribution, and solubility.

- **Procedure**:
  - **Data Preparation**: Use a molecular dataset with known lipophilicity values. Ensure molecules are represented using SMILES notation.
  - **Modeling**: Deploy a pre-trained OpenVINO model optimized for regression tasks, fine-tuned to predict lipophilicity.
  - **Deployment on OpenShift**: Containerize the model and deploy it on RedHat OpenShift for scalable predictions. The platform supports container orchestration, ideal for real-time lipophilicity assessments.
  - **Output**: Predicted lipophilicity scores allow for screening molecules based on their potential suitability in drug development.

### Step 2: Binding Affinity Prediction

- **Objective**: Evaluate the binding affinity between molecules and biological targets, which is crucial for efficacy.

- **Procedure**:
  - **Data Preparation**: Gather a dataset with labeled binding affinities for various protein-ligand pairs. Represent ligands in SMILES and proteins in appropriate 3D formats.
  - **Modeling**: Use OpenVINO for accelerated processing and inference to predict binding affinity. Models like deep docking networks can estimate molecule-target binding efficacy.
  - **Deployment**: Deploy the model on OpenShift to handle large batches, facilitating drug library screening.
  - **Output**: Generate binding affinity scores, ranking molecules by their likelihood of effective binding.

### Step 3: Molecule Generation and Scoring

- **Objective**: Generate new molecules based on an initial molecular scaffold and score them for potential efficacy.

- **Procedure**:
  - **Scaffold Selection**: Define an initial molecule or scaffold with promising characteristics.
  - **Molecule Generation**: Using RDKit with OpenVINO, create scaffold variations. RDKit modifies functional groups, with OpenVINO accelerating inference.
  - **Scoring**: Score generated molecules on metrics like lipophilicity, binding affinity, and other pharmacokinetic properties using previously deployed models.
  - **Deployment**: Containerize and deploy on OpenShift for efficient, parallel processing.
  - **Output**: Rank and select top candidates with the highest scores for further analysis.

### Step 4: Reaction Prediction and SMILES Visualization

- **Objective**: Predict chemical reactions and visualize the products to assess synthetic feasibility and optimize drug synthesis.

- **Procedure**:
  - **Reaction Prediction**: Use OpenVINO-accelerated models trained for reaction prediction. Input SMILES representations of reactants to predict potential products.
  - **Visualization**: OpenVINO generates visual representations of SMILES for chemists to analyze.
  - **Deployment**: Deploy workflows on OpenShift for real-time feedback in synthesis planning.
  - **Output**: Predicted products and visual representations support feasible reaction selection for drug synthesis.

### Step 5: Reaction Prediction with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration

- **Objective**: Enhance reaction prediction accuracy by combining external data retrieval with generative modeling. RAG retrieves examples of similar reactions, enriching prediction quality with contextually relevant data.

- **Procedure**:
  - **Data Retrieval**:
    - **Objective**: Retrieve similar reactions and synthesis pathways from a database for historical context.
    - **Method**: Qdrant stores reaction data as 4096-dimensional vectors using RDKit’s GetMorganGenerator to capture molecular structures.
    - **Implementation**: A reaction prediction initiates a query to Qdrant, retrieving similar reactions based on cosine similarity, adding context to predictions.
  - **Reaction Prediction**:
    - **Objective**: Generate reaction predictions with OpenVINO, incorporating RAG context.
    - **Model Optimization**: Convert the prediction model to OpenVINO format for accelerated inference, creating predictions in real-time.
    - **Procedure**:
      - Prepare SMILES of reactants and products as 8192-dimensional input vectors.
      - OpenVINO infers a likelihood score, augmented by RAG for context-rich insights.
  - **Deployment on OpenShift**:
    - **Objective**: Deploy the RAG-enabled system on RedHat OpenShift for scalable, efficient processing.
    - **Advantages**:
      - **Scalability**: OpenShift supports large-scale retrieval and generation workflows, enabling concurrent requests.
      - **Real-time Access**: OpenShift deployment with Gradio’s web interface supports remote access for synthesis planning.
    - **Implementation**: Containerize the workflow (Qdrant retrieval, OpenVINO prediction, Gradio interface) for scalable resource allocation.
  - **Output**:
    - **Enhanced Predictions**: RAG with OpenVINO produces contextually enriched reaction predictions.
    - **Synthesized Pathways**: Displayed Qdrant data gives researchers feasible reaction pathways, supporting practically informed decisions.
